Unique Key Entry: Users are prompted to enter a unique key before starting the CAPTCHA test, which helps in tracking individual sessions or users.

CAPTCHA Challenge Generation: The system generates a text-based CAPTCHA challenge each time a user starts a test.

CAPTCHA Image Rendering: The application dynamically creates an image for the CAPTCHA text, which is displayed to the user.

CAPTCHA Verification: Users submit their response to the CAPTCHA challenge, and the application verifies whether the input is correct.

Time Tracking: The application measures and records the time taken by the user to solve the CAPTCHA from the moment the CAPTCHA is displayed to the time the user submits a response.

Session Management: User sessions are managed to keep track of the unique key entry, start time, CAPTCHA text, and user test ID.

Database Interaction: The application interacts with a SQL-based database to store user tests and results, including user IDs, start and end times, and the type of CAPTCHA.

Server Initialization: A Flask development server can be started to serve the application, and database tables can be initialized with Flask CLI commands.

Error Handling: Basic error handling is in place for form validation, database errors, and routing issues.
